# Descriptive-Answer-Evaluation
There is a need for an automatic descriptive answer evaluation system as we aremoving towards the era of automation.  
The Manual Answer Evaluation processis an energy and time-consuming job on its own.  
In today’s time, we’ve got auto-mated systems for objectives, descriptive type answers, 
and also single sentencedanswers, and these systems do have less accuracy.  
Our goal is to develop a ma-chine learning-based automated answer evaluation system during this paper.  
The answers are evaluated by the syste based upon the matching keywords.  
The input will be given as a scanned handwritten answer sheet.  
An artificial neuralnetwork will be used by our system also with a back-propagation algorithm
